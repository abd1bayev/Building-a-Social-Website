<h2>Creating a social website project.</h2>

We are going to create a social application that will allow users to share images that they find on the internet. We will need to build the following elements for this project:

- An authentication system for users to register, log in, edit their profile, and change or reset their password
- A follow system to allow users to follow each other on the website
- Functionality to display shared images and a system for users to share images from any website
- An activity stream that allows users to see the content uploaded by the people that they follow

<h3>Summary:</h3>

I added user account features to create a social website, including user registration, password management, profile editing, and authentication. I have added social features to this site so they can share pictures and communicate with each other. Users will be able to bookmark any image on the web and share it with other users. They will also be able to see the activity of users they follow on the platform and dislike photos shared by them.
